🚀 Day 05 - Deep Learning Projects
Project from the "Mastering Applied Data Science Bootcamp"

This repository contains my study projects on Deep Learning, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), LSTM, and GANs. The goal was to explore datasets, build deep learning models, and evaluate their performance for classification, regression, and computer vision tasks.

🔹 Project Overview
The projects follow a structured workflow:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Inspect datasets, check missing values, visualize distributions and correlations.

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  Handle missing values, scale numerical features, encode categorical variables, split data into training and testing sets.

- **Model Building**  
  Implement ANN for classification and regression tasks.  
  Implement CNN for image classification.  
  Apply RNN/LSTM for sequential data (if applicable).  
  Use Early Stopping to prevent overfitting.  

- **Model Evaluation**  
  Evaluate performance using metrics such as accuracy, R² score, RMSE, and visual inspection of results.
